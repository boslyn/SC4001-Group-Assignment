## Flowers Recognition
This project implements a deep learning pipeline for classifying flower species from the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset, a collection of 102 flower categories commonly found in the UK. In this project, our objective is to develop and implement a classification model to classify the flower images. Beyond the standard classification models, we will be exploring advanced techniques to further improve the models developed. 

## Dataset
- The dataset is available in TorchVision
